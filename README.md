<h2>🚀 How to Use</h2>

1. Clone the repository  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Abdullah1218-bit/Machine-Learning-From-Scratch.git
   cd Machine-Learning-From-Scratch
Open any dataset folder inside ml-project

Run the Jupyter notebooks step by step

For Home Credit Default Risk, download dataset from Kaggle and place in the project folder

<h2>📌 Notes</h2>

The Home Credit Default Risk project is not yet complete due to dataset size and training time.

For heavy models (CatBoost, PyCaret, XGBoost), training might take longer on large datasets.

👉 This version is **professional + visually appealing**, uses emojis for datasets/files, and includes **Kaggle link, features, usage instructions, and notes**.  

Do you also want me to add a **Table of Contents** at the top (with clickable links to sections like 📂 Projects, 📊 Cheatsheets, 🚀 Usage, etc.) to make navigation easier?
